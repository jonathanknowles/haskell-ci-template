An example of a Haskell project with working continuous integration provided by GitHub Actions.

Features:

- Support for multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, and MacOS).
- Haddock documentation is generated and published automatically via GitHub Pages. (See [documentation](http://jonathanknowles.github.io/haskell-ci-template).)
- Hyperlinks for imported functions and types point to Haddock documentation hosted on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/).

The [GitHub action](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/haskell-ci-template/actions) is inspired by:

- https://kodimensional.dev/github-actions
